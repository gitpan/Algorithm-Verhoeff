Algorithm-Verhoeff version 0.3
==============================

DESCRIPTION

This module implements Verhoeff's check digit algorithm. It provides a method to
generate check digits from numbers, and a method to verify if an existing number
passes the check.

Using numbers that pass the verhoeff check is useful for things like product
codes. This is because such numbers almost never pass the verhoeff check if they
as mis-typed. This includes common typos such as ommitted or repeated digits,
transposed digits and so on.

Since it only adds a single digit onto what might already be a longish number,
it's a good algorithm for use where humans need to enter or read the numbers.

To generate such a number, pick a starting number, call verhoeff_check() to get
a check digit, and then APPEND that digit to the end of the original number.

The new number will how pass the verhoeff_check(). 


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL

DEPENDENCIES

None, although using this with integers > 32bit will require the bignum module.
